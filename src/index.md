I'm Peter, a second-year PhD student in the EECS department at MIT. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://news.mit.edu/2025/sweet-taste-new-idea-sendhil-mullainathan-0519). I am interested in **machine learning for scientific discovery**. My work is supported by the NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship.

Previously, I did my A.B. in Physics and Mathematics and S.M. in Computer Science, both at Harvard University. I am deeply grateful to [Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/) for his mentorship and for inspiring my interest in machine learning research.

To check out some of the things I've been working on:

- my [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMf2VukAAAAJ&hl=en)
- my [code](https://github.com/petergchang)
- my [tweets](https://x.com/petergchang)
- my [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSBM54glGczLVWIQHzHmHw)
- my [bicycle](https://petergchang.github.io/bicycle/)

I recently co-organized the [ML-Driven Scientific Discovery Retreat](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/ml-driven-discovery/home) and the [ICML 2025 World Models Workshop](https://www.worldmodelworkshop.org/).

If our interests are aligned, please [reach out](mailto:gyuyoung@mit.edu) to me!
