        I'm Peter. I currently work as a Research Professional at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/about">Center for Applied AI</a> with Professor Sendhil Mullainathan. <br><br>
        I am interested in Bayesian inference, state space models, and the intersection of machine learning and economics. <br><br>
        I also enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSBM54glGczLVWIQHzHmHw">playing music and making films</a>. <br><br>
        I graduated from Harvard University (Phi Beta Kappa) a while ago with AB in Physics and Mathematics and SM in Computer Science.
